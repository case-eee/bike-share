**Group Member Names:** Mike Schutte, Ethan Bennett, Caroline Powell, Molly Brown

**Project Manager:** Molly Brown

**When are group members available to work together? What hours can each group member work individually? Are there any personal time commitments that need to be discussed?**

- All group members are available to work as a group on campus at Turing from 4:30-6:30pm on weekdays until project is considered done. We will also meet 1:00pm-5:00pm on Saturday, Dec. 3 and Sunday Dec. 4.

**What does each group member hope to get out of the project?**

- Ethan: Strong grades (3's-4's), looking forward to applying the concepts we have learned the first week of Mod 2 and having it come all together in an project with real-world applicability.
- Caroline: Get stronger as testing, learn Bootstrap, use CSS custom styles to customize the front-end component of our project.
- Schutte: Stoked on testing and refactoring and looking forward to tackling a large project with the added challenge of working with a large group. 
- Molly: An idea of how closely a project can follow an agile workflow on a small-scale level, and lessons learned going forward. Excited to see first CRUD app take form.

- Group Goal: Be at "3" evaluation level across the board on broject by Wednesday AM. 

**How will group members communicate? How often will communication happen, and how will open lines of communication be maintained?**

Before each work period we will take ~15min for each person to share what they worked on yesterday, what they plan on working on today, whay went well, what went poorly, and any blocker issues. After each work period we will take ~5 min to cover next steps. 

We have planned to make plenty of time for face-to-face communication, and will be using Waffle to coordinate our work. We expect one another to send a Slack message to the entire group when a merge to master is made or when a new branch is checked out for new feature development.

Proposed Workflow:
  1.  Check Slack.
  2.  Check Waffle for tasks ready to be worked on.
  3.  Assign yourself to a card and move to in progress when working.
  4.  Move to done when done with the task. 

**What is expected of group members when they run into problems implementing a feature?**

Group members are expected to practice responsible timeboxing when implemeting features. Once a member is out of time, they are expected to reach out to another group member and work through the issue as a pair. 

**Is there anything else the group should know about personal work/communication styles?**

All members feel as if they sometimes need alone time to absorb ideas, so we will do our best to honor this for one another. Schutte requests we call him out if he gets too smothering about the code he wrote, and Caroline said that sometimes she has difficulty putting her ideas into words quickly, so silence after a question likely means she just needs more time to process how to reply.
